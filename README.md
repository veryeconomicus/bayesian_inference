## Economic Returns to Education: A Gender and State-Level Bayesian Approach

### Abstract
The education has long been commanded as a premier investment on human capitals, with an established economic importance and implications on lifetime earnings (Becker 1964, Mincer 1974, and Card 1999). In spite of the rapid accumulation of empirical observations in many different countries and time periods confirming that more-educated individuals earn higher wages than their less-educated counterparts, an education premium is gradually losing its lustre amid the rising college tuition in the United States married with mix of industrial shifts. The trend has culminated in a new social phenomenon “Toolbelt Generation”, where more youngsters in the US are turning down traditional college paths in a disenchantment – choosing tools over textbooks (Chen 2024). The aim of this paper is to scrutinize the heterogeneity in returns to education, probing beyond the conventional averages to uncover the stratified impacts of an education premium. By wielding a dataset rich in demographic granularity, encompassing variables such as location, gender, and ethnicity, the analysis is tailored to discern the contextual nuances that shape the economics of education. The approach seeks to illuminate how educational returns fluctuate in response to varying socio-economic landscapes, this providing a nuanced understanding that resonates with the ‘Toolbelt Generation’s’ diverging individual-specific path. In doing so, I aim to furnish policymakers, educators and individuals concerned with the investment decisions of profound importance with insights that could better align educational strategies with the shifting contours of economic demand.
